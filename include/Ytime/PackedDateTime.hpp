/** @file This file defines a memory efficient representation of
    Gregorian dates and time. The resolution for time is microseconds
    and years range from 1200 to more than 500,000.

    PackedDateTime has several advantages, first it has no invalid values,
    every value maps to a unique date and time; second is it's a 64-bit integer
    so all operators that apply to integers also applies to dates and times,
    in particular assignment, comparison, additionÂ´and subtraction operators;
    third, all these operations are very fast.
